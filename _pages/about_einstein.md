I am a MPhil graduate from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, passionated in neurosciences of human decision making. Since my day as an undergraduate, I have already developed a huge interest in the predisposition of people's choices and judgment. Despite the huge variety of information that could go into the equation, I believe there are parameters that were relatively constant and they represent what we called 'personality'. My research interest is to discover how these parameters are encoded in our nervous system.

After I graduated from City University of Hong Kong in 2013, I have worked in different laboratories to gain experiences of practical research (mainly intervention study) and neuroimaging techniques (e.g. EEG, fMRI), and finished my MPhil degree at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2021. Since then, I worked as a member of the research team in a service-based project that promote mindfulness-based intervention (MBI).

Currently, I am seeking an PhD opportunity in Canada, while remotely work as a part-time Research Officer for the mindfulness project. Although I am working in a food factory to support my living, I am still actively working on various reseasrch projects and manuscripts (in fact, even more focus on research-related tasks than my full-time period). If you are in Toronto and want to make friend with me, feel free to contact me through my email or social media.
