  abstract = "Reward positivity (RewP), an event-related potential observed 250–300 ms after feedback, is hypothesized to reflect the dopaminergic response to the reward prediction error (RPE) during the reward processing. However, the traditional grand averaging approach of ERP analyses cannot answer whether RewP is merely a response to RPE valence in a categorical way (i.e., better-than-expected or worse-than-expected) or reflects the computation of RPE in a parametric way. In this study, we take a model-based approach to explore the effect of RPE on RewP. Specifically, we use the hierarchical Bayesian modelling to estimate individual parameter under the reinforcement learning model and extract the trial-by-trial RPE as the regressor for model-based EEG analysis. <br> <br> Thirty-seven healthy adults (19 male, 18 female, Mean age = 26.97) performed four blocks of probabilistic reversal learning task while we acquire their EEG response using a 128-channel system. The preprocessed data were segmented into 1000 ms epoch from -200 ms before to 800 ms after the feedback slides. The reinforcement learning model based on Rescorla Wagner model with separate learning rates for positive and negative feedbacks was fitted with the choice data of the subjects to estimate the hyper-parameter and individual parameters using the hBayesDM package. Using the fitted parameters, the trial-by-trial RPE is generated and input as the trial-by-trial regressors for the model-based EEG analysis using the LIMO-EEG plugin of EEGLAB. <br> <br> Traditional ERP analysis found a P200, FRN, and P300 effect of feedback valence at FCz (Fig. 1A). For the model-based analysis, one-sample t-test is applied to condition contrast (reward vs. non-reward) and RPE contrast (positive RPE vs. negative RPE). While no significant cluster is found for condition effect after correction for multiple comparisons using spatiotemporal clustering, the results reveal a significant modulation of ERP for positive RPE than for negative RPE (Fig. 1B – cluster started at 212 ms and ends at 268 ms encompassing frontocentral electrodes, mean beta value = 0.68, 95% CI [-0.07 1.42], maximum t-value = 5.20 at 232 ms channel F6, corrected p-value = 0.003). The results support that a more positive RPE predicts a more positive EEG response at frontocentral region, though the corresponding time is earlier than the typical RewP time window. Model-based analysis provides an alternative angle to the average-based RewP and shed a new light on the temporal dynamic of reward computation. It provides direct evidence that the “early” RewP encode positive RPE in a parametric way.",

  abstract = {In prospect theory, loss aversion is one important parameter that modulates one’s decision in involving risk. Previous studies find that amygdala activity is related to the degree of loss aversion during the action-selection processes. In this study, we examine the brain response associated with decision outcome and how that varies across subjects with different degrees of loss aversion. We expect that people with high loss aversion experience stronger emotional impact when receiving a negative outcome after taking risk. We hypothesize a person’s degree of loss aversion could be reflected by the BOLD contrast across decision outcomes. <br><br>   To test this hypothesis, we recorded and analysed the fMRI data of twenty-one participants (10 males and 11 females; M age = 17.9 ± 0.75) during the Loss Aversion Task (LAT). The LAT was implemented with a rapid event-related design in which participants were given two options: NoGamble option with a guaranteed outcome and Gamble with 50% chance of getting a better-than-NoGamble outcome and 50% chance of getting a worse-than-NoGamble outcome. The utility of the two options varied so that one option has higher or equal utility respect to another. Participants were presented with a feedback indicating the outcome. Loss aversion coefficient (lambda; ƛ= −beta loss / beta gain) is estimated by fitting the behavioural responses to the logistic function. A higher lambda value indicates stronger loss aversion, with ƛ = 1 meaning equal weight for gain and loss. <br><br>  We find feedback-related activities at medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) but find no significant difference among the valence of feedback (gain, loss, no-gain/loss). Condition contrasts reveal that the activity of the left posterior insular cortex during gambling loss relative to guaranteed loss is negatively correlated with participants’ lambda. In the other words, gambling loss elicit stronger insula response relative to guaranteed loss in participants with lower lambda, while those with higher lambda do not differentiate between gambling and guaranteed loss. The insular cortex potentially increases the sensitivity of the anticipated loss, or alternatively, reduces the sensitivity to the gamble loss. Both interpretations lead to the likelihood a person choose to take risk in a long run given both gambling loss and guaranteed loss had similar subjective value in the past. In conclusion, the individual difference in loss aversion could be capture by condition contrasts in a LAT and gives insight to the model of outcome-value encoding.}
