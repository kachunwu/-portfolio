When I revisited my github profile and was considering how to revamp it, I met the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/) template, which helps people to build beautiful academic website. I first learned about jekyll and immediately fell into the work to started constructing my portfolio website. 

One thing I like the most of jekyll is that it automatically deploy changes in my code to the live website. Although it still require coding (unlike GUI like Adobe Dreamweaver, that I learned in my primary school), it still simplified a lot of the formating work since I am already familiar with markdown.

Besides my portfolio, I would also like to add some useful resources such as example code that helps other psychology students and researchers to know how to code in R. 

Let's get back to work!
