I am starting to add my previous works to the [publication](/publications) section. I have seen BibTex so many times in the past 10 years, but I have never thought of learning it. Usually I organize my references list using Mendeley, which have a good GUI and can sync to the cloud. Building this website led me to learn BibTex for the first time, and it is quite easy to grasp if you are familiar with the JSON format.

The simplest way to import my publication is to export all my work from the ORCID to the BibTex (which can be done by a few button press on orcid.org), but I would like to add more to let those who are interested have access to my materials. I added the pdf files of the article that I contributed and two posters I have presented in online conferences. I am still exploring how to categorize these publication, just to make things more organized.

Although it is still a short list, I hope this is just the beginning of a long list.
